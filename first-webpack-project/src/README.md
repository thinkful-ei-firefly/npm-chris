# Creation of my webpack lesson

**Steps taken to perform this action was as follows:**

1. Read carefully for the proper instructions conveyed in the lesson plan. I began by creating the main files on the local machine.

2. Made the directory "first-web-project" Performed the npm init -y to create the json package. went inside of the package to configure the semantics and specifics of the project name and description.

3. git init add - A

4. then I committed the json package to github.

5. installed jQuery package to the directory then configured it with the node_modules/

6. created the .gitignore file and continuously committing and pushing in case of net drop

7. I then checked the status of the git and discovered the new files.

8. installed the webpack into the project by copy and pasting the code from the lesson plan

9. created a folder named src as well as a dist folder for future purposes

10. Added all files to the src folder and created the boilerplate in the html file.

11. while creating the webpack config js file... I copy and pasted all of the snippets from the lesson into the respective file.

12. npx webpack allowed for everything to be created and compiled into the main.js file located in the dist folder.
